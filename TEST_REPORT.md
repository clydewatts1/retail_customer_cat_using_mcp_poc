- Customer CUST_00375: ✓ All departments match class totals (High-value customer)
- Customer CUST_00156: ✓ All departments match class totals
- Customer CUST_00105: ✓ All departments match class totals

**Data Integrity:** 100% - Every department total equals the sum of its child class totals

Cluster 3 (VIP Champions): 75.8 purchases, $17,423.49 revenue, 16 days recency
```

### 4. Neural Network Clustering ✓
- **Clusters Created:** 4
- **Silhouette Score:** 0.3526
- **Reconstruction Error:** 0.0179

**Cluster Centers:**
```
Cluster 0: 9.8 purchases, $604.46 revenue, 85 days recency
Cluster 1: 75.7 purchases, $17,122.15 revenue, 16 days recency
Cluster 2: 3.2 purchases, $124.74 revenue, 265 days recency
Cluster 3: 25.4 purchases, $2,719.13 revenue, 47 days recency
```

### 5. Cluster Enrichment ✓
- **Enriched Profiles:** 4
- **Segments Identified:**
  1. **Hibernating (15.2%)** - At-risk, need re-engagement
  2. **Need Attention (30.2%)** - Moderate engagement
  3. **Loyal Regulars (31.8%)** - Consistent buyers
  4. **VIP Champions (22.8%)** - High-value customers

### 6. Unit Tests ✓
**Test Suite:** 9/9 tests passed
